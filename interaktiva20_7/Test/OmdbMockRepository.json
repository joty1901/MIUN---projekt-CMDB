    "Plot": "In first century Rome, two student friends, Encolpio and Ascilto, argue about ownership of the boy Gitone, divide their belongings and split up. The boy, allowed to choose who he goes with, chooses Ascilto. Only a sudden earthquake saves Encolpio from suicide. We follow Encolpio through a series of adventures, where he is eventually reunited with Ascilto, and which culminates in them helping a man kidnap a hermaphrodite demi-god from a temple. The god dies, and as punishment Encolpio becomes impotent. We then follow them in search of a cure. The film is loosely based on the book Satyricon by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, the \"Arbiter of Elegance\" in the court of Nero. The book has only survived in fragments, and the film reflects this by being very fragmentary itself, even stopping in mid-sentence.",

When Governor Jackson and his daughter, Diana, visit the region, Amarchandra launches a protest and also leads villagers to a meeting that is being addressed by Mohandas Gandhi much to the chagrin of his father. Nevertheless, Amarchandra continues with his protests, and even humiliates Jackson. Then Jackson orders additional men and ammunition via a train from Delhi to deal with Amarchandra, who finds out and decides to sabotage and blow up the train. Little does he know that he will soon be betrayed by one of his own men, Bahadur, and not only he, but his father, as well as his sweetheart, Swarnamukhi, will all be killed. Years later in an independent India, Amarchandra will be re-born as Ashok, an unemployed, middle-classed, slacker and trouble-maker, who lands a job with TV24 as a reporter, and will soon be pitted against the corrupt and seemingly invincible 80 year old Bahadur, who now calls himself Vijay Kumar, and who is soon to be the country's Prime Minister.",

    "Plot": "A story, unique as to pictures, founded on fact and produced with absolute fidelity to nature. A news item in the English edition of the Cairo news (Africa), dated ten years ago, begins this startling series of picture events: British Ship Zanzibar Founders Off East Coast. Frightful fate would await castaways, as the country is uninhabited for hundreds of miles. Then we are shown a raft in mid-ocean bearing the only two survivors of the lost Zanzibar, Capt. Jack Ownes and his daughter Essie. A few hours later we get a glimpse of the African shore line, showing the captain and his daughter both lying senseless where the remorseless waves have tossed them. Five Years Later we see a rude cabin built of grass, mud and brush. The labor of its making has kept the brave captain and his daughter from madness, the utter hopelessness of their being rescued from this desolate region has finally become a settled conviction with them both, so they live as best they can, fighting as primeval man had to fight for food and shelter; the sea has washed ashore from the Zanzibar many things which have helped them in their present situation, the skins of animals protect them from the heavy dews of night, and the captain has learned through necessity to keep their larder stocked with his bow and arrows. An evil day comes; the father is stricken with fever, and in spite of his daughter's loving care, he succumbs, leaving Essie alone. For weeks afterward the girl barely exists, but at last the desire for life returns and hope, the feeling an all-wise Providence gives to humanity as a safeguard against our ills, regains possession of her mind and she fights on alone. One day in the woods she hears a wail, it sounds like the cry of an infant in distress. Upon investigation she discovers two baby leopards in the hollow of a tree; the girl hungers for companionship, so she determines to take the kittens to her home and as she reaches the door the mother leopard bounds into view. The girl, nothing daunted, clings to the babies. A strange scene follows; the fearless girl and the mother leopard become friends, she is alone no longer. One Year Later. Two animal buyers are starting for the interior. We follow the interesting movements of these men. We see them pitch camp in the jungles, trap leopards and other wild animals. Gates Finds Essie. A dense jungle; a white man with three native gun bearers is following a leopard track; suddenly he sees a magnificent specimen lying contentedly in his path, he raises his rifle, a human voice utters a cry, and a beautiful girl, clad in leopard skins, falls with arms outstretched across the body. Essie sees a human face and hears her mother tongue for the first time since her father's death. A few weeks later Jordan starts back with the first consignment of animals, leaving Gates to follow with the rescued girl. Essie has not only made friends with the leopard family, but being gifted by nature with a strange power over animals, she has taught them to obey her. We witness her giving Gates a demonstration of this power. The girl is alone in the world, and upon her return to civilization must have a means of livelihood. Gates is a showman and knows that an act such as Essie will be able to give with her pets will prove a revelation to the jaded theatergoers of America and Europe, so he proposes the scheme to Essie. She has grown very fond of her rescuer and is willing to be guided by his advice. Gates puts his men to building crates, and we see the party start back for civilization. At Cairo, Loading the animals on board a steamer bound for Paris. Then four weeks later we witness Essie's first public appearance. Gates has had scenery arranged to represent the girl's rude African abode, and the transplanted leopards, thinking themselves back in Africa with their Queen, obey her slightest wish, to the delight of a vast audience and as Gates takes the girl in his arms after her triumph, we see that the future bids fair to be as bright to Essie as the past has been unkind; the desolate days spent in darkest Africa are forgotten.",

Fidel also listens to the people's concerns about food distribution, bad roads and transportation. Landau captures Cuba's revolutionary chief early in the morning in his tent. The camera zooms in on his dirty and delicate fingernails holding his trademark cigar while he tells a story of SÃ­mon Bolivar and offers tactical advice to guerrilla warriors throughout the Third World.The film contains rare and fascinating archive footage of the Bay of Pigs invasion and scenes of Che Guevara alongside interviews with political prisoners. Spectacular photography and editing with hot Cuban music provide the cinematic aesthetics that give this film beautiful form to accompany its exciting content.",

On the way to their new home, Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the area. They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro. Chihiro must rely on Haku to save her parents in hopes of returning to their world.",

    "Year": "2006",

    "Runtime": "128 min",
    "Genre": "Biography",
    "Director": "Tony Palmer",
    "Writer": "N/A",
    "Actors": "Claire Bloom, Richard Burton, David Hare, John Heilpern",
    "Plot": "In 1956 John Osborne changed the face of British theatre with his emotionally charged play, Look Back in Anger. Set in a scruffy flat in a typical town in the Midlands, and starring anti-hero Jimmy Porter as the first \"angry young man\" railing at national apathy, the play captured the imagination of the increasingly disillusioned post-war British public. A unique aspect of this two-hour film about the playwright is the recent discovery of extracts from some of the original stage performances of Osborne's most famous plays, material of great historical importance not seen for almost 40 years - Laurence Olivier in 'The Entertainer'; Albert Finney in 'Luther'; Nicol Williamson in 'Inadmissable Evidence'; Robert Stephens in 'Epitaph for George Dillon'; Jill Bennett in 'A Patriot for Me', with a very young John Osborne as Reidl, as well as behind-the-scenes footage from Osborne's Oscar-winning film Tom Jones. Contributions are from Richard Burton, David Hare, Kenneth Tynan, Tony Richardson, Claire Bloom, John Heilpern (Osborne's authorised biographer), Peter Nichols, Christopher Hampton, Jocelyn Herbert, Charles Wood, Kenneth Tynan, Tony Richardson, Natasha Richardson, Lindsay Anderson, Peter Bowles, Ben Walden, Terence Frisby, Bill Bryden, Sylvia Syms, Bill Kenwright, Robert Fox, Anthony Page, and the late Helen Osborne.",

This is an exceedingly grand visual and musical camp satire of the golden days of the B-movie horror and science-fiction genres.
